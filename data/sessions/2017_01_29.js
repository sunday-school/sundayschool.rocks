Today we talked about generating websites with jekyll.

Here are some links!

- https://github.com/amonks/jekyll-template

this is a sorta starter-jekyll template I made. The README.md file has links to some helpful info, and kinda describes what's going on.

- http://jekyllrb.com/docs

jekyll documentation

- https://shopify.github.io/liquid/

- https://prose.io

usable editor for jekyll sites on github

- https://try.github.io

you can do all the jekyll stuff without using git on the command line, but this is a cool starter if you're trying to get into that.
